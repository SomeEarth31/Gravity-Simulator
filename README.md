The NBodys2,cpp file is the C++ file for my code. It takes a CSV file as an input with a header line and the subsequent lines containing the required information:(mass, x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, charge)

It outputs N+1 CSV files('nplanet.txt' or 'nelectron.txt.'). N files contain the information of each planet/electron after a given time, and the remaining file is a 'data.tmp' file which has all teh data dumped. It can be used to plot our data using GNU plot.
